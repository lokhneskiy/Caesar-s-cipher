**Caesar-s-cipher**

Hello

In this repository I wrote a small code called "Caesar's cipher".
Caesar's cipher is the first cipher used in the world.

Caesar's cipher or shift cipher is a symmetric monoalphabetic encryption algorithm in which each letter of the plaintext is replaced by one that is distant from it in the alphabet by a constant number of positions. 
The Roman emperor Julius Caesar used a shift cipher with key 3 for private correspondence - he substituted D for the letter A, E for B, and so on.
